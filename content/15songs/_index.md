## About

From slave spirituals of the antebellum era, to jazz clubs of Harlem and Chicago and Bob Dylan's Greenwich Village folk sessions, songs have served an important role on both personal and collective levels. Throughout the history of the United States music has provided commentary, solace, and soundtracks for critical events. Over the next sixteen weeks we will examine fifteen songs that have both influenced American history and provide an alternative way of analyzing American history.
