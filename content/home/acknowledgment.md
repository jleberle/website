<small>I live and work on lands represented by Native Nations whose sovereignty existed prior to the arrival of colonial settlers and the current state of Oklahoma. Stillwater is the traditional territory for Comanches, Wichita, Kiowa, and Osage, as well as being situated on lands ceded by the Muscogee and Seminole Nations. Otoe-Missouria, Pawnee, and Ponca Tribal Nations also have deep histories and connections to the land around Stillwater. Oklahoma is also the home for 39 federally recognized Tribal Nations, many of which were forcibly removed from their traditional homelands in the 19th century.</small>
