I am currently an adjunct instructor in the history department at Oklahoma State University. My research focuses on the history of Indigenous activism in the United States during the 20th century, with a particular focus on activism after the 1973 Wounded Knee Incident.

I currently teach various undergraduate history surveys at OSU and have taught courses such as History of the Present and U.S. History in 15 Songs.
